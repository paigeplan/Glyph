## Purpose ##
Glyph is an Image-based communication app for non-verbal individuals. It serves  
as a app replacement for traditional picture card binders (PECS) [(see image)](http://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/251456122294-0-1/s-l1000.jpg)

## Features ##
*	Ability to add icons to the the “IconTiles” CollectionView. Each icon   
will have an image and a label. When the user presses an Icon, it will   
audibly read out the label that corresponds to it. This feature replaces  
the traditional picture card binders that many orally impaired or autistic  
individuals use. 
*	Ability to create custom keyboards that are based off of words rather  
than individual characters. That will enable the user to more easily  
type out sentences, if they are not comfortable with typing or able  
to type out full sentences using a standard keyboard. Once they  
complete typing out the sentence, they can press a “Speak” button  
that will audibly read out the sentence (if they are non-verbal,  
this automated voice will allow them to “speak” to others).

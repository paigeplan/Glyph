Chameleon for iOS
=========

**Chameleon** is a lightweight yet powerful color framework for iOS. It was built on the idea that software applications should not only function effortlessly, but should also look beautiful. 

### What is Chameleon?

Chameleon is the **first and only** color framework that focuses its full attention and efforts on "flat colors". With Chameleon you can easily forget about RGB values, forget about wasting hours figuring out the right color combinations to use in your app, and forget about worrying whether your text will be readable on your collection of different backgrounds. Chameleon does all the heavy lifting for you. All it takes to get started are a few lines of code.

### Chameleon vs Other Color Libraries

Chameleon solves a problem that many other color libraries tend to overlook. Many of them tend to get lost in adding tons of features, that they forget to ask themselves whether developers will ever need to use most of them. Others just provide color extensions that add a few colors, leaving developers in the same place they were before, except with more choices. 

Chameleon on the other-hand seeks to do more, for less. It is currently the only framework that can build beautiful flat color schemes from any color you have in mind, it can generate random flat colors, return the complimentary flat color of any color you could imagine, and can even return the closest flat color to any of your non-flat colors currently in your app.
